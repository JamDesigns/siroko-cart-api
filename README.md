# 🛒 Siroko Cart & Checkout API

## 📦 Features

- Add, update, and remove products in the cart.
- Retrieve cart contents.
- Checkout and generate persistent orders.
- Full domain decoupling from the Symfony framework.
- Domain events for all key actions.

## 📑 OpenAPI Specification

- Although not provided in YAML format, the collection is exported via Postman and included in the repository:

🗂️ postman/SirokoCartAPI.postman_collection.json
🌍 Uses the environment variable: base_url → http://127.0.0.1:8000

### 🔧 Endpoints - Cart

- POST /cart/{cartId}/items – Add item to cart
- PATCH /cart/{cartId}/items/{productId} – Update item quantity
- DELETE /cart/{cartId}/items/{productId} – Remove item
- GET /cart/{cartId} – View cart contents
- GET /carts – View all carts (for debugging)
- DELETE /cart/{cartId} – Empty entire cart

### 🔧 Endpoints - Checkout

- POST /checkout/{cartId} – Finalize cart and generate order
- GET /orders – View all generated orders

## 🧱 Domain Model

- Cart → Root aggregate holding CartItems
- CartItem → Line in cart, containing product + qty + price
- Order → Immutable order after checkout
- Value Objects: Money, Currency, Quantity, Product

## Domain Events

- ProductAddedToCart
- ProductQuantityUpdatedInCart
- ProductRemovedFromCart
- CartEmptied
- OrderCreated
- These events are dispatched internally using a custom EventBus (prints messages to the console).

## 🧪 Testing
